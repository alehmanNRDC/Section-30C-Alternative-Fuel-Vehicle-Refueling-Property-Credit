# EV Tax Credit Flag Script

This script identifies adjacent low-population census tracts that qualify for the EV Tax Credit program, helping to highlight how adjacent census tracts can be identified for program eligibility quickly and effectively. This script performs the following:

1. Pulls census tract data and relevant demographic information.
2. Identifies low-population census tracts.
3. Flags low-income, neighboring tracts through spatial joins and population analysis.
4. Outputs a CSV file, Eligibility_Flags.csv, with flagged census tracts and Empowerment Zone information.
